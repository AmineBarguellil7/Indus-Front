During my internship at smart for green, I explored a variety of technologies like Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube, and the Django Rest Framework. A highlight was completing a project that combined React, Django, and a PostgreSQL database. Using React Leaflet, I created interactive maps with polygonal shapes to mark supervision areas. The app included an easy-to-use admin interface and a user portal for real-time alerts about issues in specific areas. This experience solidified my tech skills and emphasized the power of innovation in problem-solving.
